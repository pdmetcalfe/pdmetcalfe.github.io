I just had a really unpleasant hour attempting to follow the Windows 7
installation instructions for a Wacom graphics tablet.  (No, it isn't
mine, before you rush to judgement.)  Open box, read manual, follow
manual, manual says it will auto-install drivers and software.  Oh no
it doesn't.

Eventually, after trying the obvious solutions (unplug, turn off and
on again a few times, type [meaningful incantations into
google](http://xkcd.com/627/)), in some despair I attempt a by-hand
download of fresh drivers.  And 100 meg later --- or so --- it works.
At least it saved itself from the lump hammer.

So I was a little worried when it came to installing it on the Actual
Proper Linux box.  I plug it in.  I expect smoke, fire, explosions,
segfaults.  What happens?  It Just Worked.

I've used linux since the days when if you didn't type the right
modelines into the X config your monitor would explode.  But I've only
just noticed that hardware got easy all of a sudden.  I suppose that
now Windows is the obscure system that Real Men use, that's just Too
Hard for us mere mortals.

My, doesn't time fly?
