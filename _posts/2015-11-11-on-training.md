One phrase that is absolutely guaranteed to drive me into a (possibly
internal) foaming rage is "I haven't been trained on _specific
technical skill_".  Just as good is "I need training on _specific
technical skill_".  Why is this so annoying?

Umm.  Well.  There's a whole Internet out there of information.  There
are libraries.  There's even wikipedia.  There's lots of ways that you
can learn if you want to find out how to do something.  None of them
involve me learning it for you first.  If you say "I need training on
_specific technical skill_" you're telling me that you have abdicated
the responsibility for your own learning.  Good for you.  It doesn't
make it my problem. (Yes, I know.  It's hard work.  Tough.  There is
no royal road to geometry.)

The one currency that (oh $DEITY) knowledge workers have is the things
they know how to do.  If you're telling me to train you, you're
telling me that you don't have the wit to learn yourself. 

This is motivated, somewhat, by "We need training in R".  Sorry, you
don't.  What you need is to _use it_.  Use it badly.  Realise how
you're using it badly, why's your code unmaintainable, why can't it be
re-used.  What can you do to make it better?  Talk to someone, ask
them, iterate.  At some stage, if you're talking to me, I _will_ direct
you to SICP.

But don't either stop learning or expect me to do it for you.  I can't.
