OK, R is great.  It has two incredible virtues:

1. it is not SAS,
2. it is not Splus,

and I'll forgive it much for those.  And it is a half-decent programming
language with a respectable heritage.

But

- `stringsAsFactors` ?
- the database API ?
- a core development team that seems actively hostile to the idea of unit tests ?

are all minuses.

But the big issue is approximately 90% of CRAN, which seems to be made
up of that which someone has written as their first undergraduate
exercise in coding.  500 line functions, 30 parameter APIs, etc.  Who
would do that?

And please spare me from the packages that have taken it upon
themselves to rewrite linear algebra routines in their own C code
because it was too hard to Read The Fine Manual.
